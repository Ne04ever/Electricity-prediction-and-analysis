* Conducted in-depth analysis and prediction of household energy consumption using
machine learning algorithms, including Sarima, Sarimax, Prophet, XGBoost, and LSTM.
* Cleaned and categorized data based on household equipment, ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of the data used in the analysis.
* Demonstrated a strong understanding of statistical analysis, data processing, and machine
learning techniques, while proving the "No Free Lunch theorem" in the context of
household energy consumption prediction.
* Developed an interactive dashboard using streamlit framework to showcase the results of
the analysis and predictions, enabling users to interact with the data and explore the
results in real-time
